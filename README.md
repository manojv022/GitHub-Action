   - GitHub Actions is a feature of GitHub. GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows developers to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying their applications.
   - With GitHub Actions, developers can define workflows that describe how their code should be built, tested, and deployed. These workflows can be triggered automatically based on certain events, such as code pushes or pull requests.

- By using GitHub Actions, Time can be saved and errors reduced by automating repetitive tasks. For example, a workflow can be created to automatically build and test the code every time a pull request is created.

- Workflow is a YAML file that defines a set of actions that should be performed automatically when a certain event occurs within a project.
